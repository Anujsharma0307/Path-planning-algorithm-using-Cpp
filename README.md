# Path-planning-algorithm-using-Cpp

Course: COSC 1076 - Advanced Programming Techniques

In this assignment I have implemented a simplified algorithm for Path Planning, and use it with a simple
simulated 2D robot moving around a room.


Major Learnings: In this assignment I have:

  •Practiced the programming skills such as:
  
    – Pointers
    – Dynamic Memory Management 
    – Arrays
    
  •Implement a medium size C++ program using predefined classes
  
  •Use a prescribed set of C++11/14 language features
  
Milestones:
  
•Milestone 1: Writing Tests.
•Milestone 2-4: Implementation of the Path Planner.
•Style & Code Description: Producing well formatted, and well
documented code.

How to Run:

To compile this program, you will need to use a command similar to the following:

g++ -Wall -Werror -std=c++14 -O -o assign1 Node.cpp NodeList.cpp PathPlanner.cpp main.cpp

./assign1
